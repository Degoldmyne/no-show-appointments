# An Investigation into why Patients Fail to Show up for Appointments

### By Leleji Godwin Lucky

## Dataset
The dataset consists of over 110,000 rows. Each row have information on a single patiend and whether they showed up for their appointment or not.
The dataset was collected in Brasil. Udacity's goal for this project was to introduce students to the Data Analysis steps.

The analysis contained is by no means exhaustive as it's only an introduction to the data analysis workflow.

## Summary of Results
After carrying out the analysis on the dataset, i discovered that women and children tend to honour their appointments than men.
While this could be due to the fact that there were more women in the dataset than men, the proportion of women and children that kept their appointments was also higher than the men who did.
